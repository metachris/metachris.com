Happy, busy, and frequently getting up way too early for my liking. üòÇ Either way, now I seem to find a little bit of time again to hack around and play with interesting things, and even to post about it!</p><p>(Recently I&rsquo;ve updated this blog - migrated to a new Hugo version, and gave it an overall UI update and cleanup.)</p><p>I was thinking about filming myself while working on projects. I&rsquo;ve kept reading that it can be fun and interesting. As an added benefit this is great documentation not only for one self but also for future generations :)</p><p>Well, I&rsquo;ve decided to give it a shot as today&rsquo;s evening project. I&rsquo;ve set up <a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)</a>, played around and started my first recordings! üéâ</p><p>OBS is a great piece of open source software, and if you want to support the developers you can do it through Patreon and Open Collective: <a href=https://obsproject.com/contribute>https://obsproject.com/contribute</a>. A particular shout-out to Hugh &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; Bailey, who is OBS Projects full-time lead developer.</p><p>.</p><p>The first video I properly recorded documented updating this homepage and introducing CSS dark mode. It took surprisingly only around 10 minutes, I thought it would be more.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure if I will keep it just for myself or also share or stream on Twitch. I think I will just experiment a little bit with it in the next couple of weeks. Let me know if you are interested!</p><p>You can reach me at <a href=https://twitter.com/metachris>https://twitter.com/metachris</a>. I will announce new posts and projects through my newsletter at <a href=https://tinyletter.com/metachris>tinyletter.com/metachris</a> - subscribe if you want to receive irregular emails and updates!</p><p>See you soon. ‚ô•Ô∏è</p></div><hr><form class=tinyletter-subscribe action=https://tinyletter.com/metachris method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit="window.open('https://tinyletter.com/metachris','popupwindow','scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true"><div><label for=tlemail><small>‚ö°Ô∏è</small> &nbsp;Subscribe to new posts:</label>&nbsp;
