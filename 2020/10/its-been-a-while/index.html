I&rsquo;ve kept reading that it can be fun and interesting. As an added benefit this is great documentation not only for one self but also for future generations :)</p><p>Well, I&rsquo;ve decided to give it a shot as today&rsquo;s evening project. I&rsquo;ve set up <a href=https://obsproject.com/>OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)</a>, played around and started my first recordings! 🎉</p><p>OBS is a great piece of open source software, and if you want to support the developers you can do it through Patreon and Open Collective: <a href=https://obsproject.com/contribute>https://obsproject.com/contribute</a>. A particular shout-out to Hugh &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; Bailey, who is OBS Projects full-time lead developer.</p><p>.</p><p>The first video I properly recorded documented updating this homepage and introducing CSS dark mode. It took surprisingly only around 10 minutes, I thought it would be more.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure if I will keep it just for myself or also share or stream on Twitch. I think I will just experiment a little bit with it in the next couple of weeks. Let me know if you are interested!</p><p>You can reach me at <a href=https://twitter.com/metachris>https://twitter.com/metachris</a>. I will announce new posts and projects through my newsletter at <a href=https://tinyletter.com/metachris>tinyletter.com/metachris</a> - subscribe if you want to receive irregular emails and updates!</p><p>See you soon. ♥️</p></div><hr><div style=height:14px></div><div style=float:right></div><div class=bottomAbout style=display:flex><div><a href=https://twitter.com/metachris><img src=https://www.metachris.com/images/profile2-round.png alt=Chris class=profile style=max-width:60px></a></div><div style=padding-left:20px class=me><a href=https://twitter.com/metachris>Chris Hager<br><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></div></div><div class=bottom-post-links><div class=prev><span class=title>OLDER POST</span><br><a href=https://www.metachris.com/2018/10/city-of-zion-project-report-june-to-august-2018/>City of Zion Project Report — June to August 2018</a></div><div class=next><span class=title>NEWER POST</span><br><a href=https://www.metachris.com/2020/10/a-new-version-of-logzero-is-released-v1.6/>A new version of logzero is released (v1.6) 🎉</a></div></div><footer><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=metachris/metachris.com-comments issue-term=og:title theme=preferred-color-scheme crossorigin=anonymous async></script></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container></section></footer></main><script src=https://www.metachris.com/js/dark-mode.min.c2d8a1f8f2660e4a46d776277c72695a1e0ca65939d79f754441d47551604af5.js></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-168016633-1"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","UA-168016633-1")</script><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700%7CMerriweather:300,700%7CSource+Code+Pro:400,700&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link rel=stylesheet href=https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.11.2/css/all.css integrity=sha384-KA6wR/X5RY4zFAHpv/CnoG2UW1uogYfdnP67Uv7eULvTveboZJg0qUpmJZb5VqzN crossorigin=anonymous></body></html>
