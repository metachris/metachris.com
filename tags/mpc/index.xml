The paper introduces an effective algorithm for secure, collaborative signature generation using threshold signatures, and an API-key based client/server protocol that allows user-specific limits and restrictions as well as key revocations and rotations.
The method supports all blockchains that use ECDSA and EdDSA signatures, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum and the majority of popular cryptocurrencies.</description></item></channel></rss>
