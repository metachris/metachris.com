Writing the code live in front of the audience helps to nail down the central theme of "this stuff isn't actually as scary as it looks".</p></blockquote><p>And another one:</p><blockquote><p>Being in the crowd during this talk was seriously like being at a rock concert.</p><p>Beazley was 'playing' the keyboard like an instrument. Every square inch of floor space had someone sitting or standing. The crowd was incredibly invested - nary an eye nor ear wavered. Even Guido looked on with a hawk eye.</p><p>I was in a small circle on the floor of people who had just smoked some amazing herb before the talk. I was hanging on his every word and every expression. I've rarely felt so engaged by a conference talk. I'll never forget this one.</p><p>He received a raucous standing ovation that is not evident from the conference video.</p></blockquote><p>Reach out to me via <a href=https://twitter.com/metachris target=_blank>@metachris</a>.</p></div><hr><div style=height:14px></div><div style=float:right><div class=tags><i class="fas fa-tag"></i>
