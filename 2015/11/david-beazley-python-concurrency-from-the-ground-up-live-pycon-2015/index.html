Writing the code live in front of the audience helps to nail down the central theme of "this stuff isn't actually as scary as it looks".</p></blockquote><p>And another one:</p><blockquote><p>Being in the crowd during this talk was seriously like being at a rock concert.</p><p>Beazley was 'playing' the keyboard like an instrument. Every square inch of floor space had someone sitting or standing. The crowd was incredibly invested - nary an eye nor ear wavered. Even Guido looked on with a hawk eye.</p><p>I was in a small circle on the floor of people who had just smoked some amazing herb before the talk. I was hanging on his every word and every expression. I've rarely felt so engaged by a conference talk. I'll never forget this one.</p><p>He received a raucous standing ovation that is not evident from the conference video.</p></blockquote><p>Reach out to me via <a href=https://twitter.com/metachris target=_blank>@metachris</a>.</p></div><hr><form class=tinyletter-subscribe action=https://tinyletter.com/metachris method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit="window.open('https://tinyletter.com/metachris','popupwindow','scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true"><div><label for=tlemail><small>⚡️</small> &nbsp;Subscribe to new posts:</label>&nbsp;
