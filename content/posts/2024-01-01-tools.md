This post is an incomplete collection of notes and tips on how I setup and use my computer and tools. Perhaps you find some of it useful for your own setup!

<!--more-->

During writing I realized how this is just capturing a part of the full setup, and that it's futile trying to describe everything that seems relevant. I decided to still publish the post in this incomplete form, and am sure I'll keep adding to this post over time.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas and additional tips in the comments below!

## Mac setup

##### General system setup

1. [Full Disk Encryption with FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac) (seems not necessary anymore with Apple silicon)
2. [Backups with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) (use a dedicated SSD, and [encrypt the backup disk with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac)!)
3. Password manager
    - I prefer local-first tools like Keepass over online solutions like 1Password.
     - I use [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org) on Mac, and [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en&gl=US) on Android. There are [many clients](https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass) compatible with Keepass database format
     - Sync across devices and phones using shared drives like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
     - Put _all_ your passwords in the password manager, and use it to generate new passwords.
     - Regularly make an offline backup of your password database.
4. Install all system updates
5. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
6. [Set a custom hostname/computer name](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287760/set-the-hostname-computer-name-for-macos)
7. I like to [hide the Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-desktop-dock-settings-mchlp1119/mac), the menu bar, and [desktop icons](https://gist.github.com/metachris/141e2bb21ac66868bdacdf43058d9b1b#file-aliases-L112), to minimize distractions.
8. I use a `~/ToDelete` folder to dump and download stuff that I can delete later without second thoughts. It's less cognitive load than wiping a `Downloads` folder which might contain relevant things.
9. Set custom screenshot location (I use `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, with a bookmark in Finder):
    ```bash
    mkdir -p "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true
    ```
    ![Finder screenshot](/images/posts/tools/finder1.png)
10. Very fast key repeat rate:
    ```bash
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 20
    ```
11. Protip: check out more possible settings [here](https://gist.github.com/llimllib/3fc4fefcfc0152dad8c58201246d8802), [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos) and [here](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles/blob/master/setup-macos.sh). Pick carefully and choose only those you like.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigating the system with keyboard shortcuts is a huge productivity boost! I use them constantly in particular for opening/switching applications and for arranging windows.

##### Application shortcuts

I'm using these shortcuts to open applications (or switching to them if already opened), using an app called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/):

- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> = Terminal
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> = Notion
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> = MacPass
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> = Chrome
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Firefox
- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Finder

They are setup through ["Workflows" in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/):

![Alfred screenshot](/images/posts/tools/alfred1.png)

I also have a few shortcuts for opening files selected in Finder in a specific application:

- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> = PixelMator
- ...

The Alfred hotkey settings look like this:

![Alfred screenshot](/images/posts/tools/alfred2.jpg)

##### Arranging windows

I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) for tiling windows. <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> opens Moom, and the arrow keys quickly arrange windows across halves and quarters of the screen:

## Browser

For using the browser, I only have a few quick tips:

1. Use **profiles** for different contexts, i.e. personal, work, personal, and more. Also, color-code them! I also have specific profiles for various AWS accounts, screen recording/streaming, etc. This makes it seriously easier to manage and separate browser history, logins, passwords, bookmarks, and it also helps quite a bit with focus!
2. Use **URL shortcuts** to quickly access often frequented websites. For instance, to visit my website I simply type <kbd>w</kbd>. You can set this up like this:
   - **Chrome**: Settings -> "Add search engine": <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/chrome-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
   - **Firefox**: Add a bookmark, edit it, and set the shortcut as "keyword": <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/ff-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
3. I recommend these Chrome extensions:
   - [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?pli=1)
   - [JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
   - [Unhook - remove YouTube distractions](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid)
   - [Google Arts & Culture](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-arts-culture/akimgimeeoiognljlfchpbkpfbmeapkh) (no distractions on new tabs)
   - [Authenticator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai) (2FA)

## Terminal

It's worth the effort to setup your terminal nicely and become intimately familiar with using and navigating it.

I've written [a separate post on my Terminal and Bash setup and usage](/terminal-and-bash.html).

## Docker for Node.js and Python

pip/yarn is considered harmful, because any package can execute arbitrary commands during installation!

Instead, I recommend using Docker for Node.js and Python projects. This way, you can easily switch between projects with different versions of Node.js and Python, and you don't have to worry about installing packages on your host system.

You can use a Makefile like this to execute common tasks in ephemeral Docker containers:

```makefile
IMAGE := node:20
PORT := 3000:3000 # host:container, see also https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish
CUR_DIR := $(shell pwd)

docker: docker-deps docker-start

docker-deps:
        docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm install

docker-start:
        docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm start

docker-build:
        docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm run build
```

- [**Keyboard Shortcuts**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
    - Become familiar with the most important keyboard shortcuts! It's worth the effort.
    - Check out the [keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet here](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) (or open it with <kbd>⌘k</kbd> <kbd>⌘r</kbd>).
    - Adjust keyboard shortcuts to your liking (open the settings with <kbd>⌘k</kbd> <kbd>⌘s</kbd>).
    - Some of my favorite [default keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf):
        - Toggle left sidebar: <kbd>⌘b</kbd>
        - Toggle bottom pane: <kbd>⌘j</kbd>
        - Jump to terminal: <kbd>^`</kbd>
        - Open new terminal: <kbd>⇧^`</kbd>
        - Quickly search files by name: <kbd>⌘p</kbd>
        - Search for symbols: <kbd>⌘t</kbd>
        - Move cursor to last position: <kbd>^-</kbd> (and <kbd>⇧^-</kbd> to come back again)
    - Some of my favorite custom keybindings:
        - Rename: <kbd>⌘r</kbd> (rename is used much more often than "open recent")
        - Search across all files: <kbd>⇧⌘F</kbd> (I use this a lot)
        - Find all references: <kbd>⇧⌘R</kbd>
        - Go to definition: <kbd>⇧⌘C</kbd>
        - Go to type definition: <kbd>⇧⌘T</kbd>
        - Peek shortcuts just like the above, but with control instead of shift
