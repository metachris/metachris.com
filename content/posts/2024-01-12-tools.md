How I setup and use my computer and tools for development.

I wrote this mostly as a guide for myself, for the next time I setup a computer, and hope it might be useful to others too.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas and additional tips in the [comments below](#comments)!

## Mac setup

##### General system setup

1. [Full Disk Encryption with FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac) (if you don't have Apple silicon or an Apple T2 security chip)
2. [Enable backups with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) (use a dedicated SSD, and [encrypt the backup disk with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac))
3. Install all system updates
4. Use a **password manager**!
    - I prefer local-first and open-source compatible tools like Keepass over online solutions like 1Password.
     - I use [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org) on Mac, and [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en&gl=US) on Android. There are [many clients](https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass) around that work with Keepass database format.
     - You can sync passwords across devices with shared drives like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
     - Put _all_ your passwords in the password manager, and use it to generate new passwords.
     - Regularly make an offline backup of your password database.
5. [Set a custom hostname/computer name](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287760/set-the-hostname-computer-name-for-macos)
6. Install Xcode Command Line [Tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/8.html): `xcode-select --install`
7. I like to [hide the Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-desktop-dock-settings-mchlp1119/mac), the menu bar, and [desktop icons](https://gist.github.com/metachris/141e2bb21ac66868bdacdf43058d9b1b#file-aliases-L112), to minimize distractions.
8. I use a `~/ToDelete` folder to dump and download stuff that I can delete later without second thoughts. It's less cognitive load than wiping a `Downloads` folder which might contain relevant things.
9. Set custom screenshot location (I use `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, with a bookmark in Finder):
    ```bash
    mkdir -p "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true
    ```
    ![Finder screenshot](/images/posts/tools/finder1.png)
10. Very fast key repeat rate:
    ```bash
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 20
    ```
11. Protip: check out more possible settings [here](https://gist.github.com/llimllib/3fc4fefcfc0152dad8c58201246d8802), [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos) and [here](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles/blob/master/setup-macos.sh). Pick carefully and choose only those you like.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigating the system with keyboard shortcuts is a huge productivity boost! I use them constantly in particular for opening/switching applications and for arranging windows.

##### Application shortcuts

I'm using these shortcuts to open applications (or switching to them if already opened), using an app called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/):

- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> = Terminal
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> = MacPass
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> = Notion
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> = Chrome
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Firefox
- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Finder

They are setup through ["Workflows" in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/):

![Alfred screenshot](/images/posts/tools/alfred1.png)

I also have a few shortcuts for opening files selected in Finder in a specific application:

- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> = PixelMator
- ...

The Alfred hotkey settings look like this:

![Alfred screenshot](/images/posts/tools/alfred2.jpg)

##### Arranging windows

I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) for moving and resizing windows ([RectangleApp](https://rectangleapp.com/) is an alternative).

I've configured <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> to open Moom, and then mostly use the arrow keys quickly arrange windows across halves and quarters of the screen:

![Moom screenshot](/images/posts/tools/moom1.png)

## Browser

For using the browser, I only have a few quick tips:

1. Use **profiles** for different contexts (i.e. personal, work, and others)
   - Use different colors to easily identify them visually!
    - I also have specific profiles for various AWS accounts, screen recording/streaming, etc.
    - Separate profiles makes it significantly easier to use have contextual browser history, logins, passwords, bookmarks, and it also helps quite a bit with focus.
2. Use **URL shortcuts** to quickly access often frequented websites.
   - For instance, to visit Hacker News, I simply type <kbd>n</kbd> and press enter. You can set this up like this:
   - **Chrome**: Settings -> Add search engine -> Add Site Search: <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/chrome-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
   - **Firefox**: Add a bookmark, edit it, and set the shortcut as "keyword": <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/ff-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
3. Some of my favorite Chrome extensions:
   - [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?pli=1)
   - [JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)
   - [Unhook - remove YouTube distractions](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid)
   - [Google Arts & Culture](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-arts-culture/akimgimeeoiognljlfchpbkpfbmeapkh) (no distractions on new tabs)
   - [Authenticator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai) (2FA)

## Terminal & Shell

It's worth the effort to setup your terminal nicely and become very familiar with using and navigating it.

I've written [a separate post on my Terminal and Bash setup and usage]({{< ref "2024-01-04-terminal" >}}).

## Docker for Node.js and Python

Installing packages with pip/npm/yarn is considered harmful, because any package can execute arbitrary commands during installation!

I strongly advise against running `pip` or `yarn` or `npm install` directly on your machine. Instead, use Docker for Node.js and Python projects, and you don't have to worry about installing packages on your host system.

You can use Makefiles like these to execute common tasks in ephemeral Docker containers, while mounting the current directory as a volume to `/mnt` (and using that as working directory):

##### Node.js

```makefile
IMAGE := node:20
PORT := 3000:3000 # host:container, see also https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish
CUR_DIR := $(shell pwd)

docker: docker-deps docker-start

docker-deps:
	docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm install

docker-start:
	docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm start

docker-build:
	docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) npm run build
```

##### Python

```makefile
IMAGE := python:3.12
CUR_DIR := $(shell pwd)

docker-deps:
  docker run -p $(PORT) --rm -it -w /mnt -v $(CUR_DIR):/mnt $(IMAGE) pip install -r requirements.txt

# ...
```

## Visual Studio Code

- I'm using the [**Insiders version of VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), which brings daily releases for early adopters.
- [**Remote Development**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) is extremely useful to work remotely on servers and containers with a local VS Code instance (using this [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)). It's almost a local development experience!
- [**Recommended Extensions**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
    - [**GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) - manage and quickly navigate PRs and issues. Also adds sharing options to the context menu when clicking on specific line numbers.
      <img src="/images/posts/tools/vscode-share.jpg" style="max-width:340px;"/>
    - [**GitLens — Git supercharged**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - git history and more.
    - [**Markdown All in One**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) - pretty good for markdown content, but overwrites some default shortcuts (i.e. <kbd>⌘b</kbd>, check by going to keyboard shortcut settings and search for "markdown").
    - [**Code Spell Checker**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - a simple but working spell checker.
    - AI Tools
        - [**GitHub Copilot**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - AI-powered code suggestions.
        - [**GitHub Copilot Chat**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) - chat with Copilot about code.
    - Programming languages
        - [**Go**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) - Golang language support.
        - [**rust-analyzer**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) - Rust language support.
        - ...
- [**Keyboard Shortcuts**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
    - Become familiar with the most important keyboard shortcuts! It's worth the effort.
    - Check out the [keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet here](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) (or open it with <kbd>⌘k</kbd> <kbd>⌘r</kbd>).  <br> {{< figure link="/images/posts/tools/vscode-shortcuts.png" alt="Project logo - Gopher and Ethereum logos" >}}
    - Adjust keyboard shortcuts to your liking (open the settings with <kbd>⌘k</kbd> <kbd>⌘s</kbd>).
    - Some of my favorite [default keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf):
        - Toggle left sidebar: <kbd>⌘b</kbd>
        - Jump to terminal: <kbd>^`</kbd>
        - Open new terminal: <kbd>⇧^`</kbd>
        - Quickly search files by name: <kbd>⌘p</kbd>
        - Search for symbols: <kbd>⌘t</kbd>
        - Move cursor to last position: <kbd>^-</kbd> (and <kbd>⇧^-</kbd> to come back again)
    - Some of my favorite custom keybindings:
        - Rename: <kbd>⌘r</kbd>
        - Search across all files: <kbd>⇧⌘F</kbd> (I use this a lot)
        - Find all references: <kbd>⇧⌘R</kbd>
        - Go to definition: <kbd>⇧⌘C</kbd>
        - Go to type definition: <kbd>⇧⌘T</kbd>
        - Switch between code and terminal: <kbd>^\\</kbd>
        - Peek shortcuts just like the above, but with control instead of shift: <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/vscode-context.jpg" style="max-width:640px;"/>
        - You can download [my custom keybindings in JSON here](https://gist.github.com/metachris/bca3e1196faa1f2f0dc0186f53ccae52)
- **Multiple cursors** are a powerful tool for quickly changing multiple / many things or occurrences at once!
  - Add cursor by mouse: <kbd>alt</kbd> + click
  - Add cursor by keyboard: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + arrow up/down
  - Add cursor at next occurrence of current selection: <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd>

## Github tips & tricks

Lastly, I wanted to mention a few very useful shortcuts for Github:

- On any Github repository you can open an interactive editor with a single key (also works on pull requests):
  - press <kbd>.</kbd> to open in [github.dev editor](https://github.dev/) (Visual Studio Code for the Web).
  - press <kbd>></kbd> to open in [github.dev editor](https://github.dev/) in a new tab
  - press <kbd>,</kbd> to open in [codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).
- You can synchronize your local VS Code settings and keybindings with github.dev via [Settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)
- When writing comments, you send it with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
  - On PR reviews, this starts a review; to leave a single comment you can use  <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
- Press <kbd>/</kbd> to open and focus the search bar (code search)
- Press <kbd>?</kbd> to show [all keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/keyboard-**shortcuts**)
