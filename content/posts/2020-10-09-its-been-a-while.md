Oh wow, it's been about two years since my last post, and oh boy were those eventful! Most notably, I'm now a father of two üê•üçº. Happy, busy, and frequently getting up way too early for my liking. üòÇ Either way, now I seem to find a little bit of time again to hack around and play with interesting things, and even to post about it!

(Recently I've updated this blog - migrated to a new Hugo version, and gave it an overall UI update and cleanup.)

I was thinking about filming myself while working on projects. I've kept reading that it can be fun and interesting. As an added benefit this is great documentation not only for one self but also for future generations :)

Well, I've decided to give it a shot as today's evening project. I've set up [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/), played around and started my first recordings! üéâ

OBS is a great piece of open source software, and if you want to support the developers you can do it through Patreon and Open Collective: https://obsproject.com/contribute. A particular shout-out to Hugh "Jim" Bailey, who is OBS Projects full-time lead developer.

The first video I properly recorded documented updating this homepage and introducing CSS dark mode. It took surprisingly only around 10 minutes, I thought it would be more.

I'm not yet sure if I will keep it just for myself or also share or stream on Twitch. I think I will just experiment a little bit with it in the next couple of weeks. Let me know if you are interested!

You can reach me at https://twitter.com/metachris. I will announce new posts and projects through my newsletter at [tinyletter.com/metachris](https://tinyletter.com/metachris) - subscribe if you want to receive irregular emails and updates!

See you soon. ‚ô•Ô∏è
