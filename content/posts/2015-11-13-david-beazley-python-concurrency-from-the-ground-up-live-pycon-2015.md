A few selected quotes:

<blockquote>The fact that he walked in and did this demo from scratch while keeping the packed room engaged was incredible.ï»¿</blockquote>

A more comprehensive quote:

<blockquote><p>David Beazley's 2015 PyCon talk on concurrency was one of my favorite talks of the conference, and it was almost all just live coding.</p>

<p>Part of what made that talk compelling was that it took a concept that lots of people find complex/intimidating (how the internals of an asynchronous IO library work) and in ~30 minutes created a full working example in front of a live audience. Writing the code live in front of the audience helps to nail down the central theme of "this stuff isn't actually as scary as it looks".</p></blockquote>

And another one:

<blockquote><p>Being in the crowd during this talk was seriously like being at a rock concert.</p>

<p>Beazley was 'playing' the keyboard like an instrument. Every square inch of floor space had someone sitting or standing. The crowd was incredibly invested - nary an eye nor ear wavered. Even Guido looked on with a hawk eye.</p>

<p>I was in a small circle on the floor of people who had just smoked some amazing herb before the talk. I was hanging on his every word and every expression. I've rarely felt so engaged by a conference talk. I'll never forget this one.</p>

<p>He received a raucous standing ovation that is not evident from the conference video.</p></blockquote>
