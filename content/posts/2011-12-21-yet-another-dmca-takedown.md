title: Yet Another DMCA Takedown
url: /2011/12/yet-another-dmca-takedown/
---

<p>Another DMCA takedown of one of my Android apps. This time initiated by The New York Times Company for a three year old app titled &ldquo;NYTimes Article Search&rdquo;.

Instead of having their lawyers send the DMCA notice to Google which immediately suspends the respective app, they could have just sent me an email and I&rsquo;d have changed the name immediately. Quite sad how the world is driven by lawyers these days&hellip;</p>
