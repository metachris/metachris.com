## Mac setup

##### General system setup

1. [Full Disk Encryption with FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac) (seems not quite necessary with Apple silicon)
1. [Backups with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) (use a dedicated SSD, and [encrypt the backup disk with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac)!)
1. Password manager
    - I prefer local-first tools like Keepass over online solutions like 1Password.
     - I use [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org) on Mac, and [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en&gl=US) on Android.
     - There's many clients around: https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass
     - Sync across devices and phones using shared drives like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
1. Install all system updates
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
2. [Set a custom hostname/computer name](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/287760/set-the-hostname-computer-name-for-macos)
3. I like to [hide the Dock](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-desktop-dock-settings-mchlp1119/mac) and the menu bar
4. Create a `~/ToDelete` folder to dump and download stuff that you can delete later without second thoughts. It's less cognitive load than wiping a `Downloads` folder which might contain relevant things.
5. Set custom screenshot location (I use `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, with a bookmark in Finder):
    ```bash
    mkdir -p "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location -string "${HOME}/Pictures/Screenshots"
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true
    ```
    ![Finder screenshot](/images/posts/tools/finder1.png)
6. Very fast key repeat rate:
    ```bash
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
    defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 20
    ```
7. Protip: check out more possible settings [here](https://gist.github.com/llimllib/3fc4fefcfc0152dad8c58201246d8802), [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos) and [here](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/dotfiles/blob/master/setup-macos.sh). Pick carefully and choose only those you like.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigating the system with keyboard shortcuts is a huge productivity boost! I use them constantly in particular for opening/switching applications and for arranging windows.

##### Application shortcuts

I'm using these shortcuts to open applications (or switching to them if already opened), using an app called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/):

- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> = Terminal
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> = Notion
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> = Chrome
- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Firefox
- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> = Finder

They are setup through ["Workflows" in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/):

![Alfred screenshot](/images/posts/tools/alfred1.png)

I also have a few shortcuts for opening files selected in Finder in a specific application:

- <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> = PixelMator
- ...

The Alfred hotkey settings look like this:

##### Arranging windows

I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) for tiling windows. <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> opens Moom, and the arrow keys quickly arrange windows across halves and quarters of the screen:

## Browser

For using the browser, I only have a few quick tips:

1. Use **profiles** for different contexts, i.e. personal, work, personal, and more. Also, color-code them! I also have specific profiles for various AWS accounts, screen recording/streaming, etc. This makes it seriously easier to manage logins, passwords, bookmarks, and helps with focus!
2. Use **URL shortcuts** to quickly access often frequented websites. For instance, to visit my website I simply type <kbd>w</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. You can set this up like this:
   - **Chrome**: Settings -> "Add search engine": <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/chrome-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
   - **Firefox**: Add a bookmark, edit it, and set the shortcut as "keyword": <br> <img src="/images/posts/tools/ff-shortcut1.png" style="max-width:440px;"/>
3. I recommend these Chrome extensions: [JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en), [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?pli=1), [Unhook - remove YouTube distractions](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid), [Google Arts & Culture](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-arts-culture/akimgimeeoiognljlfchpbkpfbmeapkh), [Authenticator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai)
