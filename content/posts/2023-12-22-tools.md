4. Terminal
5. VS Code

## Mac system setup

**General system setup**

1. [Full Disk Encryption with FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac) (perhaps not necessary with Apple silicon)
1. [Backups with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) (use a dedicated SSD, and [encrypt the backup disk with TimeMachine](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241/mac)!)
2. Password manager
    - I prefer local-first tools like Keepass over online solutions like 1Password.
     - I use [MacPass](https://macpassapp.org) on Mac, and [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en&gl=US) on Android.
     - There's many clients around: https://github.com/lgg/awesome-keepass
     - Sync across devices and phones using shared drives like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

**Core apps**

- [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) for window management
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for keyboard shortcuts
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) for terminal
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management
- Note taking: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and/or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- Extra shoutouts:
    - [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/), a great image editor.
    - [Ocenaudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/), a neat audio editor for quick edits, slicing, merging, metadata.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Navigating the system with keyboard shortcuts is a huge productivity boost.

**Application shortcuts**

Opening apps and switching between them:

- <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> = Chrome
- <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> = Firefox
- <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> = Notion
- <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> = Terminal
- <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> = VS Code
- shift+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> = Finder

Pressing these shortcuts will either open the program, or switch to it if it's already open.

I use [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for these application shortcuts, I'm sure there's many other tools available too.

**Tiling windows**

I use [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) for tiling windows. It's a paid app, but it's worth it.

I'm using <kbd>alt</kbd> as main modifier key, and mostly use the arrow keys to quickly arrange windows.

## Browser

- Use profiles for different contexts (work, personal, social, etc). I also have different profiles for various AWS accounts.
- URL Shortcuts

---

## Terminal

- huge shell history!
- fuzzy reverse search
- iterm (customize with a custom profile)
- bash as default shell, to stay close to bash because itâ€™s used everywhere
- bash
    - functions + aliases
    - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (`z` and `zi` commands to navigate paths quickly)
    - fzf
- git
    - aliases
    - git rb
    - fzf
    - check ~/.gitconfig

---

## VS Code

- [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) (beta)
- Extensions
- Keybindings
    - rename
    - find
    - test
    - run
    - find definition / references
