<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig" target="_blank">Peter Norvig</a>, the famous American computer scientist and Director of Research at Google Inc., participated in this year's <a href="http://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> (a series of small programming puzzles), and shared his experience <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb">in an interesting blog post</a>.

The post starts with this amazing collection of Python utility functions, which may also be useful for your
next project:
