Take a look at the current instructions on how to install Node.js 6.x Long-Term Support (LTS) and Node.js 7.x.
Recently io.js and node.js merged again into a single codebase in Node v4.0.0. The fork happened in December 2014 and io.js has seen rapid improvements and fast uptake of upstream V8 features.
Now the merge has happened, and with it comes a lot of features from the io.</description></item><item><title>Retrofit 2.0 Samples</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2015/10/retrofit-2-samples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2015/10/retrofit-2-samples/</guid><description>This post is about using Retrofit 2.0 (beta) to consume HTTP based APIs.
Retrofit is a great and popular API client library for Java (and by extension also for Android) developed by Square. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few links to start things off:

Thanks to the efforts of many front-end developers and researchers who have spent countless hours on developing and evolving best practices, html5 boilerplate is rapidly maturing and establishing itself as the de-facto standard html boilerplate.
The authors just celebrated the one-year anniversary with the release of version 2.</description></item><item><title>App Engine Boilerplate</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2011/04/app-engine-boilerplate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2011/04/app-engine-boilerplate/</guid><description>I recently started appengine-boilerplate, a repository of often used boilerplate code for Google&amp;rsquo;s App Engine, which allows to quickly setup new projects without having to re-invent the most common wheels.

iPhone developer Amro Mousa published a post yesterday with recommendations about how to reach a high average rating on the AppStore, since many app users are only remembered to rate an app on uninstalling, which naturally leads to less-than-optimal reviews and ratings.
The reality is some developers pay for downloads and reviews to get higher rankings on the App Store.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Python Servers with Worker Processes and Socket Duplication</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2011/01/scaling-python-servers-with-worker-processes-and-socket-duplication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2011/01/scaling-python-servers-with-worker-processes-and-socket-duplication/</guid><description>Developing servers that scale is usually quite tricky, even more so with Python and the absence of worker threads which can run on multiple cpu cores [1]. A possible solution are worker processes that duplicate the client‚Äôs socket, a technique that allows the workers to processes requests and send responses directly to the client socket. This approach is particularly useful for long lasting connections with more than one request per session.</description></item><item><title>Unicode and UTF Overview</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/unicode-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/unicode-overview/</guid><description>This post is a brief technival overview of Unicode, a widely used standard for multilingual character representation, and the family of UTF-x encoding algorithms. First a brief introduction to Unicode:
Unicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding.
Unicode could be roughly described as &amp;ldquo;wide-body ASCII&amp;rdquo; that has been stretched to 16 bits to encompass the characters of all the world&amp;rsquo;s living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16 bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.</description></item><item><title>Advice for Android Developers: Prepare for App Acquisition</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/advice-for-android-developers-prepare-for-app-acquisition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/advice-for-android-developers-prepare-for-app-acquisition/</guid><description>Here‚Äôs a brief but important advice for Android app developers: starting with your first app, prepare for the situation where a company wants to acquire one of your applications. Use a unique signing key (alias) for each app! Else you‚Äôll be forced to either cancel the acquisition or hand out the key you use for other apps as well.

Android requires that all apps be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed.</description></item><item><title>Useful Linux Command of the Day - compgen</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/useful-linux-command-of-the-day-compgen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/useful-linux-command-of-the-day-compgen/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just learned about a particularly nice Linux shell command: compgen

Threads Threads make it possible to execute multiple pieces of code in parallel, which means either utilizing multiple processors or having the operating system schedule execution time for the threads sequentially on one processor. In contrast to multiprocessing (forking) where multiple separated processes are started, all threads run in a single process and have access to the same resources.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/about/</guid><description>I am fascinated by technology and collaboration.
